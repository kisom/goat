goat
====

`goat` is a (very) basic version of netcat. It facilitates simple TCP
transfers via a statically-compiled binary. I needed netcat to transfer
some data on a host, but it didn't have netcat; I spent ten minutes trying
to get netcat and ncat to build statically, then I just wrote this in Go
in ten minutes. I would be shocked if someone else hadn't written this,
but it was faster to write this than to look for it.

It uses only the standard library, and no external dependencies besides
a working Go toolchain are needed to build this.

Usage: goat [-4] [-6] [-k] [-l] [address] port
Flags:
	-4	IPv4 only
	-6	IPv6 only
	-k	Keep the listener open
	-l	Listen on the specified host/port.

Examples:

	Setting up a listener on port 4141:
	$ goat -l 4141

	Setting up a listener on localhost:4141:
	$ goat -l localhost 4141

	Tar a directory to a remote host:
	$ tar czf - /path/to/dir | goat filesrv.example.net 4141 > dir.tar.gz
